VGA Driver for Zedboard by Digilent. It is capable of running vga with a resolution of 640x480 @ 60 Hz. It contains a double buffered vram. The vram is currently designed to be block ram. It uses 43% of the board's BRAM.

The project contains 2 blocks.
The first block is VGA (vga.vhd). This block drives the VGA pins. The resolution can be changed easily by modifying the generics via VIVADO. The resolution of this block can be increased easily. It sends the synchronisation signals and routes the pixels to the VGA output pins.
The second block is VRAM (vram.vhd). This is a block ram implementation of the video RAM, each representing one full video frame. It contains 2 seperate brams. The user can read and write one buffer while the other is read by the VGA block. There is a simple protocoll to switch buffers.

You can use the VRAM module and the VGA module independently. By switching out the VRAM for bigger RAM (DDR via AXI).

PROTOCOLL:
To switch out buffers, after filling the current buffer with a generated frame, you have to follow the following protocoll.
	1. Set the change_frame signal to high. While 'change_frame' is set to high, no write operations should be made by the user.
	2. The frame will only be switch when the VGA port read the current frame. When the VGA module is ready to switch out the frame-buffers, it sets frame_fin to high.
	3. At the beginning of the next clock-cycle the VRAM module detects both signals and switches out the frame-buffers. The signal 'frame_switched' is set to high for the next clock-cycle, signaling that the buffers are switched out.
	4. The has to detect this signal and can continue calculating the next frame.
